## 🌌 Overview

The **Tung Tung Dweller** is an environmental horror entity inspired by the _Brainrot – Tung Tung Saur_ phenomenon.
It emerges only when night falls… and the moment you dare to look directly at it, it awakens.
Its haunting metallic “Tung Tung” sound marks the end of silence — a blend of psychological horror and pure suspense.

> _“At night you’ll hear it… during the day, you’ll feel it’s still there.”_

## ⚙️ Features

- **Visual & Audio Horror:** activates only when seen.
- **Fast, deadly reaction:** once spotted, it releases the “Tung Tung” sound and rushes the player.
- **Instant disappearance:** vanishes right after attacking, leaving no trace.
- **Daytime passive form:** the **Tung Tung Sahur** appears during daylight, distorted and harmless, but ever-present.
- **Immersive tension:** environmental sounds and visual effects keep you constantly on edge.

## 🧠 Mechanics & Behavior

### Night Activation

- Appears **only at night**.
- Remains perfectly still and silent until **eye contact** is made.
- Upon being seen, it emits its signature “Tung Tung” sound, **charges toward the player**, strikes once, and disappears instantly.
- Leaves behind no drops or signs — only the echo of its presence.

### Daytime Variant: Tung Tung Sahur

- During the day, a passive version may spawn.
- It does not attack but emits **distorted ambient sounds** that grow in intensity.
- Slowly fades away as its echo dies out, leaving the world eerily quiet again.
