## 🌌 Overview

**Silent Mask** is a Minecraft mod that adds stealth mechanics inspired by _Five Nights at Freddy’s_.
When you wear the special mask, hostile mobs completely ignore you — as if you don’t exist.
Perfect for horror maps, stealth gameplay, or FNaF-inspired experiences.

> “Put it on… and they’ll think you’re one of them.”

## ⚙️ Features

- **Stealth Mode:** All hostile mobs stop targeting you when the mask is equipped.
- **Target Reset:** Clears mob aggression if they had already detected you.
- **Total Immunity:** Walk freely among monsters without being attacked.
- **Immersive Overlay:** Adds a visual mask effect with reduced field of view for realism.
- **FNaF-Inspired Aesthetics:** Dark tones, eerie atmosphere, and emotional tension.

## 🧠 Mechanics & Behavior

### When Equipped

- They cannot re-target the player while the mask remains equipped.
- A first-person overlay simulates wearing a real mask, restricting visibility for immersion.

### Environment Interaction

- Works in all biomes and lighting conditions.
- May not affect mobs from mods with custom AI systems.
